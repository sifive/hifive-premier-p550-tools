EsBurnTool is a linux based programming tool which is
used to program bootchain, kernel and rootfs images to the board.

Bootchain image needs to be flashed to SPI Flash present on SoM Board
while kernel and rootfs will be stored on Carrier Board eMMC.

EsBurnTool will program images to board based on configurations
present in config.ini file.

Prerequisite:
	- Create a directory named "image".
		e.g. mkdir -p /home/user/hf106/image
	- Copy bootchain, kernel and rootfs images into "image" directory.
	- Configure "image" directory path in config.ini file.
		e.g. directory = /home/user/hf106/image
	- Configure serial port in config.ini file.
		- hf106 creates four serial ports as like below.
			/dev/ttyUSB0
			/dev/ttyUSB1
			/dev/ttyUSB2
			/dev/ttyUSB3
		- Out of these four ports, configure third port.
		
		e.g. serial = /dev/ttyUSB2

Usage:
	sudo ./EsBurnTool -c config.ini
