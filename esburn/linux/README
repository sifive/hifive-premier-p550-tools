EsBurnTool is a linux based programming tool which is
used to program bootchain, kernel and rootfs images to the board.

Bootchain image needs to be flashed to SPI Flash present on SoM Board
while kernel and rootfs will be stored on Carrier Board eMMC.

EsBurnTool will program images to board based on configurations
present in config.ini file.

Two seperate config.ini files are present in this directory.
1. spi_config.ini - To flash bootchain image to SPI flash
2. emmc_config.ini - To flash kernel and rootfs to eMMC

Usage: sudo EsBurnTool -c <config.ini file>

	For e.g:
	--------
	To flash bootchain image to SPI Flash
		sudo EsBurnTool -c spi_config.ini

	To flash kernel and/or rootfs to eMMC
		sudo EsBurnTool -c emmc_config.ini

To update partition table, uncomment "erase_flash" parameter and
"[mmc partition table]" section in emmc_config.ini file.
